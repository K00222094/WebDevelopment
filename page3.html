 <h1>Gameplay</h1>
         
         <p>
            The Last of Us uses an over the shoulder, 3rd person camera perspective which feels comfortable and offers a wide field of view compared to other games in the genre.  The combat mechanics are the usual punch and kick combinations, but it’s the inclusion of interactive areas, objects and debris lying around adds variety and helps beef up the games already brutal combat. The upgradable on the fly, real time crafting system is essential to survival since resources are limited, that also includes ammunition. Weapons are also upgradable, adding additional options like increasing chamber sizes and weapons sway. Searching and gathering items adds a welcome break between combat scenarios. Ellie herself will look for, point out and offer items of interest which is a nice touch to the already excellent partner AI. Using environmental objects to climb to higher areas like ladders, wooden planks and context sensitive button prompts allow these actions to take place, also giving Ellie a boost up onto higher areas is also present.<br><br>
             

 About the AI. Enemies are very adaptive to almost any combat situation and its systems are rarely broken or exposed by the player. Other than shooting first they will out flank you and even try to sneak up on you. Sneaking is also a mechanic Joel and Ellie can use. Listen mode is an upgradable mechanic that allows the player to listen for and see enemy movements and placements in real time by holding R1 in the crouched or sneaking position. This feature can be turned off to add additional difficulty.<br><br>

             Let’s not forget the infected themselves. They are just terrifying. I’ve never encountered an enemy in any game like them before. The Clicker is a blind variant that moves around using environmental or player noise and if it grabs you, your dead! Unless you have a craftable shiv which can stave it off and even kill it depending on your shivs upgrade level. Shooting them will cause them to go feral and will blinding rush the player causing panic. It’s strongly advisable to sneak up on them and take them out.<br>

                
Runners are another infected type which are manic and can rush up on you in numbers. They are not as dangerous as the Clickers, but mixed in with them can offer a deadly combination. There’s also a third and final enemy type which is known as the Bloater and its first introduction to the player offers a truly memorable encounter. They are very large, Clicker-like, bullet sponges and will tear you apart if it grabs you. They also hurl toxic spores which damage the player.


         </p>
                
<h1>Multiplayer</h1>
         
         <p>
            The games multiplayer component offers the same immersive and brutal combat in an online environment. It involves clan “Factions”. There are two factions "Hunters" and "Fireflies". Once a faction is chosen and created you’ll need to grow your clan and win multiplayer matches while collecting supplies and completing objectives. Every match progresses the story one day forward, and you'll see your clan’s population rise and fall based on your success or failure.<br>
             
            There are three different modes called Supply Raid, Survivors, and Interrogation. Each mode is 4 vs 4 players and offer either the objectives, capture the flag or last man/woman standing. It’s no Gears of War beater, but It’s a fun and welcome inclusion to an already stellar single player campaign and will offer hours of additional gameplay for those that want more. 

         </p>
                
    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
         
         <p>
             The Last of Us is in my opinion is the best game ever made. It’s excellent acting, story, characters, enemy, level design and the way the developers evolve on these points keeping the game fresh and wanting you to keep playing is a very rare occurrence compared to any previous game I’ve ever played. Only a handful of games possess these characteristics. <em>Uncharted</em> has that magic, but Naughty Dog surpasses it and offers us a grim and mature view into their own post apocalyptic vision of what happened after the world ended and how it’s populace adapted and survived. It's an essential game for any Playstation owner and it gets a 5/5.
