<h1>Intro</h1>
         
         <p>
At the time of Ninja Gaiden initial release on the original Xbox, the industry was producing and some say still are to this day, games that have far too much hand holding, are too casual, offer any kind of difficulty or force the player to think too much.<br><br> 

             That’s when Ninja Gaiden brought us back to the old days of extreme difficulty. It was the <em>Dark Souls</em> of its era and it was totally unapologetic when spamming the player with ninja throwing stars, arrows, explosives, and hyperkinetic frantic swarms of enemies. It actually took me by surprise when I first play it. I was expecting a Devil May Cry button masher and instead was treated to a lesson in how not to go into a fight without watching your surroundings and most importantly how to block, evade and strike the enemy at the right moment. These principles are essential to your survival when playing Ninja Gaiden and that doesn’t even factor in the wall crawling and flipping techniques that also for some take quite some time to master. The game was deveopled by Team Ninja lead by it’s flamboyant and some say slightly eccentric lead creator Tomonobu Itagaki, famed for his <em>Dead or Alive</em> series.
<br></p>

<h1>Story</h1>
         
         <p>
                
You play as a master ninja named Ryu Hayabusa of the Hayabusa Clan. Ryu returns to his clan’s village only to discovers it being attack by dark evil forces that are there to steal the Master Dragon Sword, a sacred weapon of great power which has belonged to the Hayabusa lineage for centuries. With his village in ruins and after a brutal early encounter with a giant Darth Vader-like samurai demon named Doku. Ryu sets out to retrieve the Master Dragon Sword and restore his clans honour as he stabs, slices, decimates hordes of demons, the undead and any other rival clan that stands in his way. It’s mostly B-Movie stuff, so anyone looking for a though provoking and well writing story can look elsewhere. The games great, gameplay, level design and pacing is more then enough.

         </p>

             <h1>Gameplay</h1>
         
         <p>
 As mentioned above the game requires you to block, evade or strike at the correct moment while offering you a completely free at the touch of button and instantly rotatable camera system. The camera also takes time to master and was a complaint from some players but the games frenetic combat and pace just wouldn’t work without it. The camera isn’t broken it’s just right, once mastered. Ryu possesses strong and light attack options and combinations of these button actions can produce some truly amazing combos. When Ryu defeats an enemy, he absorbs its Ki energy which can be used to unleashed a deadly, indefensible, automatic attack, animation that decimates low to medium strength enemies and deals significant damage to the games larger enemies and its punishingly difficult bosses.

            
         </p>
                
        <h1>Graphics</h1>
         
         <p>
             Ninja Gaiden is easily the best-looking game on the original Xbox. It ran at a native 480p widescreen resolution and at a nearly rock solid 60FPS. 60FPS, AAA console games at that era were rare and Ninja Gaiden was testament to Team Ninjas excellent programming and optimization. The game is just stunningly detailed and shares a lot of the ground-breaking visuals it’s game engine brethren <em>Dead or Alive</em> produced to wow gamers.
         
         </p>
                
                <h1>Conclusion</h1>
         <p>
Ninja Gaiden was ahead of its time and was a breath of fresh air at a time when the genre was full of unchallenging button mashers. It reintroduced to us what a fighting game should be
and it’s still to this day the best action beat’em up of all time. Even after nearly 13 years it hasn’t been surpassed. Its successive sequels tried to replicate it and failed due trying to
satisfy the casual gamer that found the original too difficult. Hopefully team ninja will return Ninja Gaiden to roots and give us a sequel worthy enough to stand or surpass the original. 10/10
