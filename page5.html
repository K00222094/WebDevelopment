<h1>Intro</h1>
         
         <p>
             The Resident Evil series introduced use to the term “Survival Horror”.  The survival aspect was to limit the player’s ability to fight back or conquer every situation by limiting ammunition, health items and also the players field of view to fixed camera angles. It’s the fixed camera angles mixed with a creepy setting and terrifying, deadly enemies is where the horror aspect came from. After many successful sequels and imitators, the genre was starting to become stale and bloated.<br> 

It’s then that Capcom along with Resident Evils genius creator Shinji Mikami decide to redefine what survival means with Resident Evil 4. Mikami dumped the fixed camera angle and introduced the now industry standard, over the shoulder, 3rd person, camera system that we’re all accustom to in modern games. Also, instead of limiting enemies Resident Evil 4 overwhelmed the player causing panic and forcing the player to use the environment and wealth of new weapons to survive. 


<br></p>
                
<h1>Story</h1>
         
         <p>
                
Resident Evil 4 takes the series in a new direction both mechanically and physically. Instead of Mansion, it’s now set in a village in an unnamed South American country and it’s Resident Evil 2’s , Racoon City survivor, Leon Kennedy who takes the reigns. He’s now working for a private security company and has been giving the task of saving the US president’s daughter who’s being held captive there. When he arrives he inadvertently clashes with the extremely hostile village natives who have this almost zombie-like stare and are hell bent on slicing or chain sawing him to pieces. After this panic inducing open encounter is interrupted by the chimes of the dilapidated nearby church and its marauding townsfolks stare respectfully and zombie walk toward it, completely forgetting their homicidal intentions toward an almost gobsmacked and relieve, Leon. He also not long after realizes that he’s not the only one on sent on mission when he encounters an old acquaintance Resi 2’s Ada Wong. But is she a friend or foe?<br><br>

             The story is  B- movie stuff at best as it usually is with the Resi series. But it’s the excellent, pacing, combat, enemies and semi-open level design that steals the show. Mixed with deadly, set piece encounters, mild puzzle solving and gripping boss battles. It keeps you wanting to persist through its lengthy 15 - 18-hour game time.

         </p>
                
                <h1>Gameplay and Visuals</h1>
         
         <p>

             As mentioned above, combat has been given an overhaul. Leon now aims and shoots from an over the shoulder camera and can with laser guided accuracy shoot points on enemy limbs causing them to either stagger, fall over or die in the most gruesome fashion. Let’s just say that explosive head shots are a favourite of mine.<br>

Visually the game was stunning for its time. It really showed what the Nintendo GameCube was fully capable of and ran at a rock solid 30FPS with 480p progressive scan. It’s lighting engine mixed with detailed enemies and environments was simple breathtaking.


         </p>
         
<h1>Extras</h1>
         
         <p>
             The game doesn’t have any multiplayer bt it does have an unlockable, addictive, time based survival mode called Mercenaries. Where the player must defeat waves of enemies to gain precious time as the games clock counts down. Also unlocked is an extra short campaign called Assignment Ada where you play as Ada Wong and experience her side of the story. It’s great little extra that’s rarely seen in modern gaming other than paid downloadable content.
             
             <h1>Conclusion</h1>
         
         <p>
             
             Resident Evil 4 is not only Capcom and Shinji Mikami greatest achievement. It paved the way for modern 3rd person games and has influenced many other great gaming series like Gears of War. It’s gameplay with its excellent level design solidifies Resident Evil 4 position as not only as one of the best games ever made but also one of the most important. It’s essential for all gamers to experience its greatness and it gets a 10/10.
