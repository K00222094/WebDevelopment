<h1>Intro</h1>
         
         <p>
             When it comes to stellar graphics, level design, character building and storytelling few come close to who most would say is one of the gaming industry’s best developers/publishers, Naughty Dog. The amazing <em>Uncharted</em> series is a true testament of their greatness and I’m very happy to inform you that The Last of Us surpasses <em>Uncharted</em> on every level and has set a new standard in how this medium should tell a story. It’s expertly helmed by once game designer now turned first time creative director Neil Drunkmann.<br></p>


<h1>Story</h1>
         
         <p>
                
The game is set 20 years after a terrible fungal disease, which resembles a real-life insect pathogen
called Ophiocordyceps unilateralis (don’t even try to pronounce it) has almost wiped out humanity
and its remnants have resorted to organised faction rivalry, banditry, and savagery. 

             You start and play as a man named Joel Miller (Troy Baker), in fact the game has a true starting point that is one of the <em>best openings to a video game ever!</em> But I won’t spoil it here.<br> Joel resides in one of the largest if not the largest faction who are simply known as the Military, who are brutal, oppressive, remnants of the old US Armed forces.  Joel takes no sides and just tries to survive any way he can with the help of his associate, Tess. Tess and Joel’s relationship is just one of the ways TLOU makes the player care about the characters in a way only the best novel, film or TV series can do. In an early fire fight Joel and Tess encounter an injured, separated, old business associate from the rival Firefly faction who had inadvertently acquired some of their initially stolen property. This Firefly is called Marlene, its leader and she has a proposition for Joel and Tess.<br><br> 

In exchange for the return of their goods and more, they must smuggle a teenage girl named Ellie (Ashley Johnson). When they accept, it sets in motion events that could change the world forever. Without going into spoilers, Ellie is very important. It’s Ellie and Joel’s relationship that’s the bedrock to the entire story and its ability to captivate the player. <br><br>

Joel lost his daughter Sarah a long time ago and as the games story progresses there starts a kind of father – daughter relationship, at least in Ellies eyes. But Joel pushes her away.  Even though Ellie is tough, foul mouthed and willing to kill in self-defence, she is nothing like Sarah, at least that is what Joel and us the player are lead to believe. Their relationship takes many turns and the people they meet and fight alongside as the games seasonal setting literally changes also contributes to the games excellent pacing.  
The second half of the game takes the characters in a whole new direction and shows us that even though the world is full of zombie-like, infected and terrifying enemies, it’s people are worse. And it’s the darkest side of humanity that’s truly frightening.<br><br> 

             Of course, none of this story could be conveyed to us without one of the industry’s biggest known actors Troy Baker, who’s chops are tested beyond their limits and he produces his best performance yet and the amazing Ashley Johnson who also delivers a memorable performance as Ellie. A truly great partnership. There’s also an excellent performance by some would say the biggest and most well-known actor in the industry, <em>Uncharted</em>'s own <em>Nathan Drake</em>(Nolan North). North’s voice is also almost unrecognizable as one of the game’s biggest villains.<br><br>

                
The games story pacing matched with truly excellent level design can easily make the player forget that the TLOU is at least an 18 to 20-hour game. It’s huge! And I didn’t want it end.
